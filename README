Instructions to compile
=======================

Assuming you want to compile the model using compiler named COMP on the machine names MACH.

1) module switch PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
2) module switch gcc/4.8.2
2) module load cray-netcdf
3) Make a link of the Options.XXX.gnu to Options (e.g. ln -s Options.lema.pgi Options)
4) "make -j6 pardebug" (for debugging) or "make -j6 paropt" (for production)

Make sure you have compiled the auxiliary libraries "libgrib1" and "librttov7" (see below).


Instructions to compile in single precision
===========================================

* GNU compiler
  - Uncomment the line "PFLAGS += -DSINGLEPRECISION" in Options.XXX.gnu (that's the switch!)
  - "ln -s Options.XXX.gnu Options"
  - "make clean"
  - "make -j6 pardebug" OR "make -j6 paropt"

* PGI compiler
  - Make sure you have switched to pgi/13.6.0 from the default (see above)
  - Uncomment the line "PFLAGS += -DSINGLEPRECISION" in Options.XXX.pgi (that's the switch!)
  - "ln -s Options.XXX.pgi Options"
  - "make clean"
  - "make -j6 pardebug" OR "make -j6 paropt"


Checklist of things to do for a trunk check-in
==============================================

1) Checkout latest trunk to make sure you are at the head before starting to work
2) Make your modifications to the source code (most often by merging a tested branch from the SVN).
3) Compile (see above)
4) Check correctness of executable using the testsuite (see test/testsuite/README for details)
5) Make sure executable runs on a COSMO-1 and COSMO-E test run (both in debug mode for short simulation
   period and in optimized mode for a full simulation)
6) Go to src/ and do a "svn revert info_lm_f90.f90" unless actual changes have been made to this file
7) Run "svn propset svn:keywords "Revision Date" *" on new source files
8) Update misc.mch file in the doc directory with local changes (this should also be
   in the log of the commit)
9) Increase version number in misc.mch file and setup template for next version (X.XnX)
10) Increase version number in bin/gen_info.sh to current version
11) Commit changes to trunk (svn commit) using the text you added in misc.mch for the SVN log message

   svn commit  [in same directory where the Makefile is contained]

12) Copy from trunk to tags (make sure that nobody else commited to trunk in the meantime).
   NOTE: in case you have forgotten something and you need to make modifications, do not checkin
   anything into the tags! Delete the tag and copy again from the trunk!

   svn copy <...>/trunk <...>/trunk_tags/X.XnX

13) Tell osm to put executable into regular COSMO-E and COSMO-1 runs

Some other useful tips
======================

1) In order to check consistency of namelists with source code you can use

   check_ftn_nl.rb -s ./src INPUT_*
